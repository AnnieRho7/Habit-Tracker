# Habit Tracker

The Habit Tracker site is designed to help users track their daily habits and monitor their progress over time. Users can add new habits, delete them, mark them as completed or incomplete, and view their weekly progress.

### Accessibility

I have ensured that Habit Tracker is accessible-friendly by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Maintaining sufficient color contrast throughout the site.
* Conducting accessibility testing using tools like Lighthouse.
